## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width="1200px"}

knitr::opts_template$set(fullwidth = list(
  fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6,
  fig.retina = 2, out.width = '100%'
))


knitr::include_url(
    "posts/2023-05-14-predicting_pay/model_studio_page.html")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

help("modelStudio")

xfun::embed_file('posts/2023-05-14-predicting_pay/model_studio_page.html')

```
