<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The topic of data quality is like that of I.T. services generally… you only ever hear about it when there’s a problem! There’s an implicit assumption among stakeholders receiving the findings of people analytics initiatives that your data is “good”. Failure to observe this assumption of high data quality can significantly (and rapidly) undermine the credibility of findings, irrespective of how small the data quality deviation!</p>
<p>From an analytical perspective, the quality of your insights can potentially be limited by flawed data. As the saying goes “garbage in, garbage out”. Coupled with stakeholder expectations, it becomes increasingly important that organisations invest time and energy in the ongoing assessment and curation of quality data to maximise the influence of data driven decision making in organisations.</p>
<p>At the same time, monitoring data quality in HR can be immensely time consuming, expensive, simplistic in execution (i.e., simple evaluation criteria such as age ranges), highly repetitive, and utterly devoid of ANY professional enjoyment! To overcome these shortcomings, we have developed an automated, multi-dimensional and scalable approach to data quality evaluation using unsupervised machine learning—Isolation Forests.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-process" class="level1">
<h1>The Process</h1>
<p>We used Isolation Forests, an <a href="https://www.adam-d-mckinnon.com/posts/2020-06-19-a-beginners-guide-to-machine-learning-for-hr-practitioners/">unsupervised machine learning</a> approach to scan employee data for potentially anomalous[1] records.</p>
<p>Our code can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/MarthaC-SBP/IsolationForrest_HR_data_anomalies">this GitHub account</a>, which followed the following process steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ingested personnel data and loaded the appropriate libraries. In our example, we used the IBM HR Attrition dataset, then installed the H2o and Pandas libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>Defined the dataset columns to include in the data quality assessment. Trained an Isolation Forest algorithm on the data. The Isolation Forest algorithm partitioned data through a forest of decision trees. Each split of the data was made randomly and the number of splits required to isolate a record indicated whether or not the record was considered anomalous. When a forest of random trees collectively produced shorter path lengths for particular records, they were highly likely to be considered anomalies.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the trained Isolation Forest model, we then predicted which records we believed to be anomalous. Of those records predicted to have data quality issues we then narrowed down to those with the highest likelihood of being anomalous using characteristics from the trained model.</p></li>
<li><p>The model has two levels of output interpretation:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Global – which dataset columns are most often related to data quality errors. At best this is interesting in identifying potentially systemic errors, which may be a catalyst for more controlled data entry parameters.</li>
<li>Local – for any given record why is it deemed an anomaly. It is this level that is most valuable in directly resolving data quality issues, and therefore, was the focus of our approach.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For those records deemed highly anomalous (our subset), we then trained a simple Random Forest model to predict the anomaly flag(s). This process was repeated multiple times for each record to increase our certainty in identifying those variables contributing to its anomaly status. Note: We kept the model simple to make identification (and interpretation) of the combination of variables contributing to each records anomaly status easy to perform. In short, we wanted the output interpretable by a wide audience, not just those familiar with machine learning outputs.</p></li>
<li><p>The generated output (see excerpt of output in image below) has two fields: 1. A unique identifier, and 2. A list of variables contributing to each records anomaly status. The unique identifier, in our case the unique Employee Number taken from the original dataset, is critical to enabling identification and access to the original record that requires review. The second column has a ranked list (ranked from most important to least) showing the variables “collectively” contributing to the anomaly status. For example, when inspecting EmployeeNumber 58’s record we see a Monthly Income only four times their DailyRate (possibly incorrect), and that the individual has been with the company 2 years, had their last promotion 2 years ago, and has 2 years in their current role, which collectively cannot all be correct–the algorithm suggests reviewing YearsInCurrentRole.</p></li>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms such as Isolation Forests can be an excellent way of automating and scaling the review of data to monitor for quality concerns. The approach lends itself to those datasets that have a reasonable level of data quality and that are looking to make further improvements.</p>
<p>The major advantage of this approach is that the Isolation Forest can identify a record as anomalous, despite no one variable in the record being out of acceptable limits. Instead, the algorithm assesses the combination of multiple variables to determine if the combination makes it seem anomalous. This is like having human intelligence review each record quickly, at scale, and without destroying anyone’s job satisfaction!</p>
<p>We propose that this approach has the potential to significantly reduce time spent on direct data quality evaluations, which has considerable direct benefits (i.e., better quality data, more representative analyses and interpretation, etc.) as well as indirect benefits (i.e., time can be spent on other value-add initiatives that can only be done by humans!). This is particularly true for smaller teams, where the need to do more with less is greatest.</p>

<section id="differences-in-training-outcomes" class="level1">
<h1>Differences in Training Outcomes</h1>
<p>The decision we are trying to inform here is: <strong>in which training format should we invest?</strong></p>
<p>The context is simple. The organisation has introduced a new digital (i.e., online e-training) for new starters. The new digital training takes half a day to complete. The traditional model of training delivery was a full-day of face-to-face activity.</p>
<p>The company wants to understand which training format to commit to in future. Enter People Analytics Team!</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="workflow" class="level1">
<h1>Workflow</h1>
<p>The workflow is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>INGEST:</strong> We began by ingesting the end-of-course assessment data from the training (previously collected). The data was from a random selection of participants that have completed the training in one of the training formats (i.e., face-to-face or digital).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ANALYSE:</strong> From there we analysed the end-of-course assessment results. This was done using some basic descriptive statistics and a simple Independent Samples t-test. Prior to performing the t-test we completed an assessment of the t-test assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VISUALISE:</strong> We visualised the results obtained from the two training formats to make it easier for our audience to interpret and understand,</p></li>
<li><p><strong>QUANTIFY:</strong> Finally, we quantified the benefits of the optimal approach.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The R code for this analysis is presented below, following the workflow steps above. In addition, some guidance regarding the steps and interpretation of the outcomes are provided. We have used namepsacing throughout to illustrate which packages are being used for any given function call. While this helps to ensure the accuracy of our code, it also facilitates learning and ease of understanding for fellow practitioners.</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="ingesting-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ingesting-data">1. Ingesting Data</h2>
<p>The first code chunk is fairly simple. We load our packages, read in our assessment results, clean the variable names, and finally take a simple look at the structure of the data to see what we are working with.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3>
<p>Our descriptive statistics indicate an interesting outcome. It appears a notable difference exists between training formats in the mean score achieved on the assessment outcome, Training B (digital) seems to achieve on average a higher score (56.5) than Training A (face-to-face). However, the question remains–is this difference statistically significant?</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2.">Step 2.</h3>
<p>Before we can perform the t-test we must check several assumptions to ensure a t-test is appropriate. The assumptions are as follows:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%">
<col style="width: 50%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Assumption</strong></th>
<th><strong>Outcome</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1. The data are continuous (not discrete).</td>
<td>Our assessment outcomes scores are continuous - <u><strong>CHECK</strong></u></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2. The data follow the normal probability distribution.</td>
<td>We will test for normality using a Q-Q plot (Quantile-Quantile plot) and the Shapiro-Wilk’s test.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3. The variances of the two populations are equal.</td>
<td>We will test for equal variance using the Levene Test.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4. The two samples are independent.</td>
<td>Our training participants could only participate in one type of training (i.e., face-to-face or digital) so our samples are independent - <u><strong>CHECK</strong></u></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5. Both samples are simple random samples from their respective populations.</td>
<td>Our participant results were randomly selected for analysis - <u><strong>CHECK!</strong></u></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the data is normally distributed and the variance across the two groups (e.g.&nbsp;Training Groups A &amp; B) are equal then a t-test can be used effectively. Let’s check the last two assumptions and then analyse the data!</p>

<p><strong>Normality</strong> Our QQ plot suggests that we can assume normality. The distribution of results are falling approximately along the reference line and within the bounds. However, the QQ plot can be sensitive to small sample sizes. To further validate normality we performed the Shapiro Wilk’s test. This test again suggests that the data are normally distributed, as the p-value (0.338) is greater than 0.05. We can assume normality!</p>
<p><strong>Equal Variance</strong> We use the levene’s test to determine whether both the training methods have an approximately equal variance. Since our p-value (0.627) is greater than 0.05 we can assume that the variance in outcome assessments scores is not statistically significantly different for the two training methods. We can assume equal variance! All our assumptions are met and we can perform the t-test.</p>
<p><strong>t-test</strong> The t-test indicates that the difference is highly significant (p-value = 0.0002); well below a cut-off of 0.01. This difference is extremely unlikely to be by chance alone and suggests that the digital training yields a better outcome, at least as defined by the assessment outcomes.</p>

<p>Our next step is to visualise the differences achieved by the two training formats. The intent here is to ensure our stakeholders can clearly appreciate that a notable difference exists, and subsequently take an investment decision with confidence. To illustrate the difference observed, we opted to use a Box-Plot, which displays the distribution of scores in each group, coupled with some descriptive statistics. As with our QQ plot, we have used the Plotly package to make the plot interactive.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpretation-2">Interpretation</h3>
<p>Our visualisation seeks to clearly illustrate that employees who completed the digital training performed better on the end-of-course assessment. This may suggest that the digital training results in better knowledge retention (i.e., they are learning more).</p>
<p>The line crossing each box on the boxplot indicates the median score of each training format. The median is the middle value achieved on the assessment results for each training format. There is a clear difference between the two groups when comparing these lines. This is worth calling out when delivering the results to stakeholders.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quantifying-benefit">4. Quantifying Benefit</h2>
<p>There are two key ways in which we can further quantify the differences of the training formats:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The percentage change in performance. We have identified the gain is statistically significant and visualised the difference above. We can make this increase in performance more accessible to a broader audience by indicating the performance gain as a percentage.<br></p></li>
<li><p>The cost difference of the delivery formats. By calculating the cost difference of delivering the training over a year or more for the two formats.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the basis of these two metrics we are in a better position to recommend a future course of action.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Using the mean score from each training group we can calculate the % gain in performance. The code is presented in the code chunk below.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpretation-3">Interpretation</h3>
<p>Our performance gains are straightforward–digital training results in end of course assessment scores that are 18% higher than traditional face-to-face delivery. This kind of result is accessible to all audiences, and is compelling! In addition, we are confident that the result is a function of the training delivery format based on the results of our t-test.</p>
<p>Our simple cost assessment also creates a compelling picture of the financial savings associated with digital training. In one year we stand to create <strong>$8,400 in savings</strong> if we move to a digital format, and this increases to <strong>$21,800</strong> at the end of two years.</p>

<section id="recommendation" class="level1">
<h1>Recommendation</h1>
<p>Our recommendation is to invest in the Digital Training! Our rationale:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Digital training is more effective!</strong> Digital training yields 18% better performance outcomes on the end of course assessment. This result is statistically significant, and more importantly practically significant, as it better sets up our new starters for success!</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Digital training is cheaper!</strong> Digital training costs $21,800 less than face-to-face training over a 2 year period. In addition, in each year we have an indirect benefit of giving 110 employees a half day back to invest in other activities!</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Digital training is more scaleable!</strong> Digital training can support an unlimited number of participants should recruitment numbers increase for any reason. The ability to accommodate increased numbers of participants also has cost implications (i.e., face-to-face becomes more expensive), further reinforcing the cost benefit of the digital training approach.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Digital training is more flexible!</strong> Digital training is not limited by pandemic conditions, and affords employees with more flexibility, a message worth reinforcing early in the careers of new starters!</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p>Further time could be invested to speak with employees that recently completed the two training formats to validate the results identified and the recommendation provided.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The above case study provides a simple example of using People Analytics to inform a HR investment decision. We used R to analyse training results, determine whether statistically significant differences existed in outcome scores, visualised the results and then quantified the benefit of the respective training modes. Collectively, the analytic evidence suggested a clear investment decision, which could be augmented with user experience feedback. <strong>Happy measuring!</strong></p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Two years ago I sat in an elevated office in Germany discussing with a colleague the value of knowing someone’s commute distance to inform their voluntary departure risk. When we worked on generating this variable neither of us could do it! Our flight risk model progressed without this variable. Months later a pandemic hit and the conversation has since (understandably) been firmly ensconced in remote and hybrid models of working. However, many sectors remain sensitive to the need to interact in person. Hospitality, Tourism and to a varying extent Retail, are indicative of this requirement.</p>
<p>It was therefore, interesting when two years later, a bit more experience under my belt (i.e., mistakes that I had learned from), I was again presented this challenge. The context was simple, a retail business was moving location and wanted to know which employees were likely to be adversely impacted. This information was to be used to inform communication efforts in advance of the move.</p>
<p>The following provides a practical guide to measuring distances using Google Maps in R. The process involves the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Calling Google Maps,</p></li>
<li><p>Unpacking the returned data,</p></li>
<li><p>Generating insights.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<section id="calling-google-maps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calling-google-maps">1. Calling Google Maps</h2>
<p>To use Google Maps you will need three things:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p><strong>Address data.</strong> We begin by loading some fictitious address data provided by the Victorian State Government – School addresses from 2015.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Workplace addresses</strong>, both an old workplace address and a new workplace address. For this example, I am using the following two addresses from Victoria, Australia:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol type="a">
<li>Old workplace address: 154 High St, Ashburton VIC 3147, Australia (Ashburton Public Library); and</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>New workplace address: Spring St, East Melbourne VIC 3002, Australia (Victorian Parliament Building).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="i">
<li><strong>A Google Maps API key</strong>, which can be set up on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps">Google Maps Developer Site</a>. The Google Maps service has a free usage quota. To access Google Maps we will use the googleway library in R.</li>
</ol>
<p>With all three pieces ready, we will then call Google Maps using the googleway::google_distance function. We will do this for two modes of transit:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Public Transport (called “Transit”) &amp;</p></li>
<li><p>Car.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unpacking-the-data">2. Unpacking the Data</h2>
<p>The data returned from the google_distance function is complicated! Consequently, it required some fiddling to unpack and format in a usable fashion.

<p>The data returned from googleway provides both the travel distance between the two points, and time required to complete the trip for the selected mode of transit. From here it is important to gauge the following:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-people-generally-better-off-travelling-to-the-new-office-location">1. Are people generally better off travelling to the new office location?</h4>
<p>This can be examined by both distance and time. However, in a city a short trip can still take considerable time. Therefore, examining the difference in time taken for the shortest option (i.e., car or public transport) appears more realistic / accurate. If the time decreased by more than 5 minutes, an improvement in commute is assumed.</p>

<p>The above table could readily be exported to Excel and delivered to Leaders, Managers, Transition Teams, HRBP’s, etc., to help inform the delivery of personalised discussions with staff regarding proposed or upcoming changes. In addition, it could also help to inform the identification of voluntary flight risks, based on negative travel experiences associated with the move. Moreover, additional analyses could be performed on this data to help inform communication efforts (e.g., clustering to develop employee personas).</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I often try to think of ways to prompt people to reach out to the People Analytics team for advice or assistance. One quick-fire way, based on this experience, is through automation. If colleagues are having to do things manually more than a dozen times (i.e., look up commute times on Google Maps), its likely the People Analytics Team can help. While automating work is not necessarily a core remit of People Analytics Team’s, it can be a highly useful approach for building both credibility and goodwill among business colleagues (i.e., low actual effort, high perceived value), which can in turn lead to bigger opportunities for both parties. In addition, this approach (and related activities) represent useful activities that can be performed in support of new site selection during a due diligence phase (i.e., pre-selecting venues).</p>
<p>In this example we used a series of addresses to calculate travel distance and time between fictitious home and work addresses for different modes of transit. While using Google Maps programmatically is not without some learning required, I hope this example assists in making it more accessible to a broader range of users. Such functions can and should be used in advance of physical location changes to help proactively identify and mitigate distance-related challenges for all parties involved, both employees and consumers.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

<p>Lachlan, a people analyst at a global company, sits down with the organisation’s Chief Strategy Officer (CSO). The CSO quickly gets to the point, stating: “Lachlan, I need your help finding a specialist to head up a new business. The opportunity is ripe—so we need to get started as soon as possible. By the end of the week, I need you to have identified a leader with the following skill set: experience in front- and back-end development, working knowledge of Amazon Web Services (AWS), knowledge of the South East Asian IT market, and fluent in Mandarin. We’ve got roughly 60,000 global employees, so surely there must be someone who fits the bill—right?”.</p>
<p>Lachlan pauses for a second before responding: “I honestly don’t know. I can certainly reach out to some contacts and look at the different datasets that we have internally, but I’m not 100% certain that I can find someone with the precise skill set that you’re looking for”.</p>
<p>The CSO frowns and purses her lips. “Okay, well how about externally? Can you find me someone from outside the company?”. Upon hearing this, Lachlan immediately looks relieved, replying: “Definitely—I can give you a detailed shortlist of specialists by close-of-business tomorrow. Would that be okay?”. The CSO smiles and nods, before adding: “How is it though that you can’t find me someone from our global internal population of 60,000, but you can provide me a list of people in 24 hours among a global population of approximately 8 billion people?”</p>
<p>Lachlan pauses, considering the problem at hand. After a few seconds, he responds simply: <strong>“Well, it’s all down to the quality of data at my disposal”</strong>.</p>
<p>This anecdote illustrates a common problem among companies of all sizes—most organisations are unaware of the skills residing within their employee population. The notion of employee skill data has garnered considerable interest of late, with interested parties ranging all the way from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tech-savvy vendors</strong> looking to apply rapidly advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI);</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People analytics professionals</strong> wrestling with a variety of challenges;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CHROs</strong> looking to provide a personalised employee experience at scale;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chief Learning Officers (CLO’s)</strong> looking to provide a tailored learning offerings to employees; and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Talent Acquisition heads</strong> looking to mobilise a greater number of internal transfers through a Talent Marketplace.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So what unites these disparate parties? Well, it’s ultimately the realisation that old skills management practices—specifically, an inability to catalogue the “gold” within the organisation—is untenable.</p>
<p>This article explores the two fundamental considerations when it comes to skills management. First, how do you acquire your employees’ relevant skill data? Second, what practical value can you then generate from this wealth of information?</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="how-to-acquire-employees-skill-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-acquire-employees-skill-data">How to Acquire Employees’ Skill Data</h2>
<p>The introductory anecdote highlights one key issue: an employee skills catalogue entirely depends upon quality data. So how about asking individual employees to complete and maintain their own employee skills profile (i.e.&nbsp;a company-specific profile similar to LinkedIn)?</p>
<p>For starters, this is unsustainable. Employees might forget to update their profile, feel like they’re too busy, or simply not see the benefits of this activity.</p>
<p>As a result, organisations must:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Minimise the amount of effort needed from each individual employee.</p></li>
<li><p>Fully exploit existing data as intelligently as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate clear-cut benefits for both individuals and wider organisations alike.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And it appears that advancements in AI—specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP)—might hold the key. NLP has already been used widely within the HR industry, especially in the field of Talent Acquisition. This technology, when used correctly, connects and distils numerous data sources to make previously unknown connections.</p>
<p>For example, the following data sources—while often scattered across the HR / IT landscape and laying dormant—already contain a wealth of valuable information about individual employees.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recruitment data</strong>: Resumes, cover letters, assessments, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Career history data</strong>: Roles previously held by individuals within an organisation, role titles, job descriptions, project descriptions, leadership roles, awards won, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning &amp; Development data</strong>: Courses undertaken and completed, development objectives, mentoring, certifications, 360-degree feedback, psychometric assessments, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance data</strong>: Performance objectives, performance appraisals, written feedback by peers and stakeholders, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>External data</strong>: Professional networking sites, professional publications, patents, blogs, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these sources (well, all aside from external data) have long been standard data collection mechanisms within the HR industry. If finance is considered the home of numbers-based insights, then HR is undoubtedly the home of text-based insights. Organisations can therefore automate the engineering of skill data by combining:</p>
<p>The various forms of employee data currently held in disparate organisational HR/IT systems.</p>
<p>Next-generation NLP technologies that can perform realistic interpretations of text-based data.</p>

<p>The above image visually demonstrates this process. By analysing and applying relevant skill data, organisations can achieve evidence-based decision-making when it comes to personnel matters. Needless to say, this brings considerable value to both individual employees and the broader organisation.</p>

<p>It’s all well and good acquiring relevant skill data, but how can it be put to good use? If used correctly, skill data can guide a wide variety of employee touchpoints within an organisation. For instance, <a href="https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2020/7/16/how-companies-are-using-talent-marketplaces-to-promote-internal-mobility">the very process of identifying the right person for a specific role</a> (as per the introductory example) is a foundational application of employee skill data.</p>

<col style="width: 33%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Employee Lifecycle Stage</th>
<th>Employee Value</th>
<th>Organisation Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Recruitment</strong></td>
<td><strong>Objective recruiting decisions that provide personalised feedback:</strong> skills are inferred from application data sources (e.g.&nbsp;CV, LinkedIn, etc.) and skill-based matches are provided to the recruiter as an additional lens. As a result, objective and tailored feedback can be provided to unsuccessful candidates (i.e., no more generic “unsuccessful” emails from organisations), which can help them take future action, e.g.&nbsp;upskilling or tailoring their job search. For successful candidates, the inferred skills captured can be used to personalise the onboarding process.</td>
<td><strong>Objective skill-based recruiting decisions:</strong> skills can be inferred from a previous role incumbent and/or data sources that describe the role (e.g., job description, performance objectives, etc.). The vacancy is then more accurately described in terms of objectives and required skills. This provides greater accuracy for candidates and the organisation, thereby improving recruitment outcomes, saving time and money. Furthermore, the influx of skills into the organisation can be captured and subsequently analysed for trends and insights. Are critical skills being recruited at an adequate pace? Which skills are difficult to source and should be built?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Onboarding</strong></td>
<td><strong>Expediting employee integration:</strong> new employees are immediately included in the employee skill catalogue. This enables the immediate personalisation of learning recommendations, mentoring opportunities, and inclusion in organisational projects. Moreover, because expertise is immediately captured, employees can play an immediate role as SME’s where applicable. This enables value contribution and subsequently engagement and satisfaction, which may otherwise take months to establish.</td>
<td><strong>Expediting employee productivity:</strong> including employee skill details in the organisational catalogue expedites the speed with which new employees can be included in work deliverables, improving employee time to productivity. In addition, skill gaps between the vacancy and candidate are assessed automatically, thereby enabling faster closure of skill gaps through training and mentor recommendations.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Development</strong></td>
<td><strong>Personalised employability assessment and development recommendations:</strong> skills data helps to compare each employee to both the internal and external environment to determine their employability. Employees can undertand how desirable their skillset is, which in turn becomes a great motivator for learning. Organisations are better equipped to provide personalised learning recommendations to employees, based on their current skills and market skill trends. Finally, by tying learning recommendations to opportunities within the company (also known as talent markeplace), employees can explore new avenues for career growth.</td>
<td><strong>Optimising training offerings:</strong> Organisations can make more objective and intelligent decisions regarding their Learning System investments, by answering questions such as: How closely does a system mirror the skills an organisation currently has, and will need in future? Does a system mirror skill trends in the different geographic markets, or just one market? How are new training offerings prioritised by the provider and will this mirror future skill requirements of the organisation? Secondly, organisations can make more effective Strategic Workforce Planning decisions regarding which skills are “built” vs “bought”. Thirdly, organisations can compare employee skills to external market trends. This transparency, when shared with the workforce, can help to facilitate a culture of learning.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Talent Identification</strong></td>
<td><strong>Objective visibility and identification of talent (i.e., non-political) that enables better employee experiences:</strong> skill based identification surfaces better employee opportunities for awards and recognition, funding opportunities, project sponsorship, project involvement, skill and career growth, and learning programs (e.g., high performer investment, university course sponsorship, etc.).</td>
<td><strong>Optimising staffing decisions:</strong> rapid identification of resident skills facilitates more effective project staffing, team configuration and ultimately organisational design. An employee skills catalogue enables decision making at scale. Better staffing decisions can directly impact innovation and productivity outcomes. The employee skills catalogue enables greater ease and precision of talent (e.g., who has skills of greatest organisational value), internal job mobility and succession.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Career Growth</strong></td>
<td><strong>Greater career transition opportunities:</strong> A skills-based talent marketplace enables employees to determine how transferable their skills are to other roles in their local or global organization. Which roles are currently open that an employee could transition into? Which roles are realistic career growth opportunities?</td>
<td><strong>Leveraging internal talent to maximum benefit:</strong> many organisations find it easier to identify and source talent externally than internally. By creating a skills-based talent marketplace, organisations can leverage the employee skills catalogue to identify and source talent with corporate knowledge, expediting onboarding. Moreover, enabling employees to easily identify opportunities internally may facilitate longer careers within organisations, thereby reducing turnover and the costs associated with recruitment, onboarding, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Managing Change</strong></td>
<td><strong>Increasingly objective, and transparent decisions with personalised feedback.</strong> Skill based decisions provide all employees with visibility during change, not just those who are well-networked. Decisions can be made in a way that systematically consider current state, SWP, employee skill utility, and thereby provide individual feedback in a transparent and valuable fashion.</td>
<td><strong>Objective and intelligent management of skill capital during change.</strong> A skills catalogue may inform the due diligence process (i.e., what are we acquiring), retention (i.e., which skill sets represent a unique value-add), and the post-sale integration process (i.e., configuring new organisations or project teams). Organisations can systematically determine the skills each employee provides the workplace as well as understanding, during times of restructure, which skills are being lost or gained during various change scenarios. This affords organisations an opportunity to remove some of the uncertainty associated with change.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Strategic Workforce Planning</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Connecting the future skill state with the current skill state.</strong> It is impossible to effectively work toward a future state skill target, without knowing which skills are currently resident within the organisation. Such understanding will inform build or buy skill decisions and learning investments.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Operational Efficiency / Knowledge Management</strong></td>
<td><strong>Finding help (i.e., skills, corporate knowledge, resources, etc.) through an internal talent marketplace.</strong> Who has the skills related to my project(s) who may not be within my current network of contacts? Has something similar been done before? Having a transparent view of the skills across the workforce means that employees can connect with others who have expertise more effectively thus proactively catalyzing innovation and productivity. Employees no longer have to wait to “hear” about new communities of practice in an information-overload environment</td>
<td><strong>An indirect approach to knowledge management and talent management</strong> can boost inclusivity across the workforce as more informal and formal network connections are facilitated. In turn, the impact of a more transparent, inclusive approach to the workforce could have significant impacts on developing the right culture at your organisation.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Offboarding</strong></td>
<td><strong>A transferable skills record that promotes employability:</strong> Leaving an organisation with a systematic, objective and comprehensive assessment of skills enables individual employability. Moreover, this benefit would ideally engender goodwill between ex-employee and organisation, encouraging advocacy and loyalty, and provide a skill passport that could readily enable future re-employment.</td>
<td><strong>Identifying skills gaps before they are felt:</strong> The outflow of skills in the organisation can be captured and subsequently analysed for trends and insights. Are any critical skills leaving the company? How are departing skills being addressed by Talent Acquisition, Career Mobility and L&amp;D activities?</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>The above list, while not exhaustive, illustrates the various ways in which skill data can underpin many major employee touch points within an organisation. The greatest benefit of skill based personnel decision making is that it provides an objective, comprehensive, and close to real time perspective of the organisation - an outcome previously beyond the reach of organisations.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-skills-could-be-the-new-business-currency">Why skills could be the new business currency</h2>
<p>Skills management has been around since the eighties. However, it has historically been complicated, highly resource-intensive, and, even worse, yielded questionable tangible value to the organisation as a whole.</p>
<p>But that’s all about to change. Technological advancements mean that organisations can identify and manage their employees’ skill sets more easily than ever before. The above discussion detailing prospective applications of skill data demonstrates the breadth of utility, and potential for objective enhancement of personnel decision making across the employee lifecycle. Moreover, skill data provides a globally universal currency for organisational decision making, thereby enabling personalised employee decision making at scale that transcends geographic boundaries.</p>
<p>By maintaining a continuous overview of the capabilities that lie within their organisation, they’ll be able to meet the future head-on—no matter what challenges they face.</p>

<h1>Why Network Analysis?</h1>
<section id="why-network-analysis-could-be-more-valuable-than-organisational-network-analysis" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-network-analysis-could-be-more-valuable-than-organisational-network-analysis">Why “Network Analysis” could be more valuable than “Organisational Network Analysis”</h4>
<p>Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) has received considerable attention in recent years within People Analytics circles globally, as illustrated by the public discussion and proliferation of companies specialising in this method. There is an appetite to learn and do more, which also speaks to the quality and actionability of insights generated. Typical ONA benefits include, for example, improved collaboration through a better view on intra- and inter-team collaboration and the identification of key individuals acting as hubs and connectors for efficient message broadcasting during change management initiatives.</p>
<p>ONA traditionally denotes the analysis of social interactions internally to inform organisational decision making. We have seen exceptional examples of this work published in the public domain from people like Michael Arena, Rob Cross, Manish Goel and many others. These are important examples; however, we could be imposing a false barrier upon practitioners by focusing too much on the ‘O’ for Organisational. While the term ONA is directionaly accurate, it limits our thinking and actions regarding the breadth of possible applications for network analysis. In other words, we are limiting the data sources we could use and the questions we could answer by only looking internally, within the organisation.</p>
<p>In academic circles, this work is often referred to as “Social Network Analysis” (SNA) and can be found in a body of literature that spans decades. SNA broadens the perspective of the discussion by using network analysis to understand social interactions. In doing so, it has generated a wealth of insights around social relationships in the fields of sociology, psychology and anthropology. There are however, once again, limitations. The field is limited to solely represent social connectedness (connections between individuals, teams, or entire companies), as opposed to simply connectedness (connections between any other type of data point – for example documents, projects, skills, knowledge areas, etc.). In a society of ever-increasing digitisation and data generation, insights into this broader concept of connectedness are of increasing value.</p>
<p>Network analysis can be applied to a variety of data types and data sources in a bid to understand this kind of broad connectedness between data, as opposed to just connections between people. Since the early 2000s, the broader scientific fields of Network Science and Complex Networks have been focusing on applying large-scale network analysis in a wide variety of other domains as well, including, for example, biology (cellular networks), neurology (brain networks), economics (corporate governance, trade networks) and finance (transaction networks, fraud detection).</p>
<p>The People Analytics field should therefore embrace the name “Network Analysis” as opposed to “Organisational Network Analysis” in order to shed the limitations imposed by the domain specific names that have previously dominated public discussion in the field, and subsequently broaden the opportunity for People Analytics practitioners to generate unique insights.</p>

<h1>What data?</h1>
<section id="what-data-is-available-for-network-analysis-beyond-the-traditional-sources" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-data-is-available-for-network-analysis-beyond-the-traditional-sources">What data is available for network analysis, beyond the traditional sources?</h4>
<p>Traditional discussion of network analysis has focused on active (i.e.&nbsp;data collection through surveys) and passive data (i.e.&nbsp;data collection through meta-data stored such as email). Both sources of data are focused on social interactions and can generate valuable insights when applied singularly or in concert.</p>
<p>Some limited discussion has been offered on the topic of behavioural network data—capturing social interaction data from electronic devices or badges worn by individuals (i.e.&nbsp;arguably a mix of active and passive approaches – an approach used by Humanyze).</p>
<p>In addition to the above three, it is our belief that a fourth source of data exists - Open Data. <a href="https://theodi.org/article/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/">Open Data</a> refers to data that is publicly available for anyone to access, use and share. Excellent examples of major governmental open data sources include the <a href="https://www.europeandataportal.eu/en">European Data Portal</a>, <a href="https://www.data.gov">Data.gov</a> (US) and <a href="https://data.gov.uk">Data.gov.uk</a> (UK).</p>
<p>The benefits of Open Data are that it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>often free</p></li>
<li><p>not as often limited by data privacy regulations, which means the data is faster to execute on</p></li>
<li><p>a valuable training tool for analysts</p></li>
<li><p>able to provide an “outside in” perspective</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> is a website oriented towards the data science community and offers a wide variety of datasets as well, but these are often focused on specific use cases and hard to use for insights for specific organisations or individuals. A major benefit of more general open data sources, like those mentioned above, is that the insights which can be gained from them can be directly applicable and valuable in a practical context as well.</p>
<p><br></p>

<section id="where-are-open-data-sources" class="level1">
<h1>Where are Open Data sources?</h1>
<p>Rich and openly available datasets are available in a wide variety of contexts. Finding the right data sources for your network analysis activity often starts with answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In which subject category or application area am I looking for insights?</p></li>
<li><p>Within this area, which types of data points and connections between them are most interesting for my analysis?</p></li>
<li><p>Which open data sources contain these types of data and what is the quality of these data sources? It’s important to assess these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Structure / format</p></li>
<li><p>Cleanliness</p></li>
<li><p>Size</p></li>
<li><p>Recency / update frequency</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, when we are analysing knowledge and innovation, open data on patent activity, journal articles, research grants, start-up activity, clinical trials and conference attendance are very valuable to gain a view on the connectedness between organisations, people and topics of interest. The structured metadata available in these open data sources are usually very rich, and it is often possible to generate multiple valuable networks using the same dataset. For example, one can use author and institutional affiliation information on documents to create various types of collaboration networks but can also create networks of connected documents by looking at shared characteristics, keywords or text.</p>

<section id="combining-datasets-to-add-even-more-value" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="combining-datasets-to-add-even-more-value">Combining datasets to add even more value</h2>
<p>Analyses based on open data can become particularly powerful when datasets are combined in a meaningful way. If you’re working with various types of documents (let’s say patents and journal articles), you can use metadata which is common to both datasets to link them together and generate combined network overviews. Document summaries/abstracts and author information are good examples of columns which can be used to link datasets.</p>

<h1>Three practical use cases</h1>
<p>The analyses in the examples below were carried out using Kenelyze, a visual analytics platform which allows anyone to create interactive network visualisations using any dataset.</p>
<section id="recruiting-through-journal-articles" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recruiting-through-journal-articles">1. Recruiting through Journal Articles</h4>
<p><strong>Data sources: journal articles</strong></p>
<p>Locating external talent with very specific, scarce technical expertise can be challenging when using traditional recruitment channels. Kenelyze supported a globally operating business active in the agricultural sector with a data-driven analysis for the identification of talent in an area of interest using journal article data, specifically authorship collaborations, and applied network analysis to identify key opinion leaders.</p>
<p>We first collected relevant data based on keyword searches in publication databases, and then constructed networks of collaborating scientists to identify key players (often professors) and the teams surrounding them (including recently graduated postdoctoral researchers and PhD students). This enabled Hiring Managers to locate previously unknown pockets of potential talent at various universities and research institutes around the world. In addition, the analysis provided an assessment of the professional maturity of identified talent, generating insights that could thereby focus their overall recruitment strategy and actions in this space.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identification of unknown potential talent</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment of professional maturity of talent</p></li>
<li><p>More focused recruitment strategy and follow-up</p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="talent-retention-during-ma-using-patent-data.">2. Talent Retention during M&amp;A using Patent Data.</h4>
<p><strong>Data sources: patent documents</strong></p>
<p>Network analysis was applied to patent data during a corporate acquisition of a technology company. Employee data was not available prior to the close of the acquisition, making preparations for people integration activities difficult. However, the company had generated many new technologies and filed numerous patents over the last 15 years, with each patent listing inventors who were employees at the company.</p>
<p>Network analysis of the acquired company’s patent data identified: (1) prolific inventors in the company’s scientific teams, (2) socially influential scientists and (3) (by combining the first two points) current and future leadership talent in the technical domains and the scientists that must be retained with the resources available.</p>
<p>Another outcome of the analysis, due to the data source utilised, was a listing of the different technologies (e.g., materials, methods, etc.) that each scientist has exposure to, thereby powering the generation of a technical profile of scientific talent within the acquired entity. Finally, patent categorisation data listed on patents for both the acquiring and acquired organisations were analysed collaboratively to identify shared technical domains in which the companies have developed technologies, and the employees associated with such inventions. This data could inform the systematic bringing together of experts and teams, thereby informing future organisational design of the integrated companies.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identification of leadership talent and key employees</p></li>
<li><p>Generation of technical profiles</p></li>
<li><p>Identification of shared technical domains for future organisational design of integrated companies</p></li>

<p><strong>Data sources: patents and journal articles combined in one dataset</strong></p>
<p>Network analysis and text analytics based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) go hand in hand. We worked with a major business active in the Food Ingredients industry in the Netherlands to help them get a data-driven view of new application areas for one of their key ingredients. Based on a combination of patents and journal articles joined in the same dataset, we created a total of three network perspectives which allowed the client to focus on: (1) key topics and the connections between them in document text similarity networks, (2) organisational collaboration networks, and (3) individual expert networks. The document networks were created by calculating similarities between document abstracts using NLP techniques. Subsequent visualisation of these textual similarities in networks is a powerful way to gain a view on any topic. Since static visualisations do not do justice to the power of network analyses, the networks were delivered as interactive visuals to enable the client to explore the output and gain further insights.</p>

<h1>In conclusion…</h1>
<p>Using the broader term Network Analysis instead of ONA/ SNA opens up the opportunity to understand connectivity between data in many other contexts external to the organisation as well, leading to new insights and benefits</p>
<p>Open Data, as opposed to traditional data sources, are quicker to collect and analyse, cheaper to obtain, analyse and deploy findings, and provide organisations with an “outside in” perspective.</p>
<p>Examples illustrate that there are many unique ways in which Network Analysis can add value to people-related decisions in organisations. The limits of this type of analysis will be defined by our collective imagination!</p>

<p>When you hear Artificial Intelligence (AI) the first thing that comes to mind are robots; in particular, the Steven Spielberg movie titled A.I. where a robot child is built that can love and behave just like a real human. This idea appears to be closer to a dream than reality. Truth is, AI is more ubiquitous than we might think. It ranges from self-driving cars, movie recommendations on Netflix, e-mail spam detection to voice-controlled assistants such as Apple’s SIRI. The fact is that AI is already present across many businesses and various industries, as is shown in the figure below (Note the low adoption rate in Human Resources).</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Still, evidence suggests that HR departments remain unable to seize the multitude of opportunities associated with AI. In part, what may be required to accelerate the adoption of AI is educational content directed at HR Professionals, not data scientists. Thus, we offer this brief guide to Machine Learning (ML), an important subset of AI, with the intent to demystify ML and make it tangible.</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="what-is-ai" class="level1">
<h1>What is AI?</h1>
<p>Let’s start with the definition. AI is a broad area of computer science with the focus on building machines that can behave in an intelligent way—akin to humans. Furthermore, we can differentiate between 1. Generalized AI and 2. Specific AI. The concept behind Generalized AI is to develop machines that can perform multiple tasks, just like Spielberg’s robot-child. This is an area still in its infancy.</p>
<p>More relevant to HR is Specific AI, which refers to the use of intelligent machines to perform only one particular task, but to do it better than a human could (e.g.&nbsp;faster, more accurately, or objectively). For example, an application that reads hundreds of CVs in seconds and identifies optimal candidates for an interview—thereby affording HR professionals greater time to perform tasks humans do better than machines (e.g., building rapport, empathy, creativity, critical thinking, etc.).</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-machine-learning" class="level1">
<h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
<p>But how can a machine be programmed to process information (i.e., data) in an intelligent way? The answer to that is Machine Learning (ML). ML is a subset of Specific AI that comes from a mix of statistics and computer science. It refers to the process of computers learning to perform a task instead of following step-by-step instructions. This is generally performed iteratively by data scientists instructing a computer if its decisions are correct or incorrect. Depending on the outcome, the computer adapts how it makes decisions in the future—in other words, “it learns”.</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The relationship between AI, ML and the three broad types of ML.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When it comes to ML there are basically three broad types:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Reinforcement Learning,</p></li>
<li><p>Unsupervised Learning, and</p></li>
<li><p>Supervised Learning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<section id="what-is-reinforcement-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-reinforcement-learning">1. What is Reinforcement Learning?</h2>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is probably best known through IBM’s Deep Blue computer, a “robot” that learned how to play chess and beat the human world champion.</p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is a type of technique that enables an algorithm to learn by trial and error, using feedback from its own actions and experiences. Much like Pavlov and his dog, Reinforcement Learning involves rewarding decisions that lead to success and penalizing decisions that lead to anything other than success—ultimately making the algorithm more intelligent in the process.</p>
<p>Examples of reinforcement learning applied in HR are a bit lean, though are most prevalent in areas such as education (i.e., applying content based on the progress of the student), finance and investment (i.e., advanced forecasting), supply chain operations (i.e., robots fulfilling orders in a warehouse), traffic flow optimization, and healthcare (i.e., accurate classification of biopsy images).</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-supervised-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-supervised-learning">2. What is Supervised Learning?</h2>
<p>The most common forms of ML across industries, and specifically the HR domain, are Supervised Learning, followed by Unsupervised Learning.</p>
<p>In Supervised Learning, we try to predict an outcome, such as whether an employee will leave the company, the risk of an employee being injured, or the ideal starting salary of a new employee.</p>
<p>To make predictions we need different input variables (i.e., variables are called “Features” by data scientists). Our input features are only limited to our imagination (i.e., what we think will be important), what data we can get our hands-on, or what data we can create (e.g., by knowing where someone works and where they live we can create a variable focused on employee commute distance). <br> ### An example: Supervised Learning informing Employee Turnover</p>
<p>Let’s examine a more detailed example of Supervised Learning—predicting who will leave an organization. Imagine that 1 in 5 new recruits leaves an organization in their first 12 months of tenure. To prevent such turnover, we could build a supervised learning model that predicts the likelihood of new starters leaving, so that our HR and managerial colleagues could intervene.</p>
<p>In this example, the model outcome being predicted is turnover risk, and the features used to predict turnover risk could include an employees’ demographic and employment characteristics (e.g., age, education level, role level, pay relative to market, month of employment, presence of development plans, and so on.).</p>
<p>Assuming such a model was highly accurate, it would enable us to understand turnover among our new starter population from three angles.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Firstly, what are the factors most influential in predicting turnover among our population. An example of such a model output is presented in the figure below, which illustrates whether a feature prevents turnover (green bars) or promotes turnover (red lines), and the relative importance of each feature in predicting turnover (i.e.&nbsp;longer lines denote more importance).</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, the model also rates the likelihood of each new starter leaving the company, enabling focused intervention (i.e.&nbsp;the risk that Adam will leave in his first 12 months).</p></li>
<li><p>Thirdly, the model identifies the features preventing or promoting turnover risk for each employee. This individualized output can enable HR professionals to take informed and personalized action, regardless of whether they personally know each employee.</p></li>
</ol>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Example output from a model that predicts employee turnover risk. The plot describes the relative importance and directional influence of features in the model. Red bars represent features that contribute to employee turnover risk, while green bars represent features preventing turnover risk.</figcaption><p></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>A supervised learning model used to predict employee turnover among new starters has the potential to reduce notable costs, including financial (e.g., separation, vacancy, recruitment, training, and replacement) reputational (e.g., eroding an EVP and/or reducing candidate appeal) and productivity-related (e.g., on average organizations invest between four weeks and three months training new employees). Some of these costs can be readily quantified so that we can identify organizational savings based on prevented turnover (e.g., preventing 2 in 10 resignations saves $xxx).</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-unsupervised-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-unsupervised-learning">3. What is Unsupervised Learning?</h2>
<p>Unlike Supervised Learning where we are trying to predict an outcome, Unsupervised Learning analyzes many variables simultaneously to identify similarities, patterns or relationships in the data. Unsupervised Learning is more about understanding what’s in the data. The two most common uses of unsupervised learning are focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clustering: automatically splitting the dataset into groups based on similarities among the features analyzed. Classically applied to consumers, but equally relevant to organizations, whereby we understand our employee segments (i.e., clusters) and determine whether our HR policies serve the segments.</p></li>
<li><p>Association mining: identifies sets of variables that often occur together in your dataset. For example, identifying injury patterns among workers at specific sites. <br> ### An example: Unsupervised Learning informing Employee Turnover</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cluster Analysis, the most famous form of unsupervised learning, can also help us better understand employee attrition. This approach can help group employees based on similar features (e.g., location, tenure, nationality, education level, age, performance level, etc.).</p>
<p>The figure below depicts the results of an analysis of the employee’s demographic features. Multiple demographic features are first reduced to two dimensions using a method called Manifold Learning (another non-supervised method), and these two new dimensions are then clustered using a method called T-SNE. The figure below shows us how the employees can be grouped together, in this case, twelve clusters, based on their demographic features.</p>

<p><br> Once grouped into clusters, the next step is to determine the risk of turnover for each group. Moreover, it is interesting to identify if there are some shared risk factors, practically indicating that employees within a cluster are experiencing the workplace in a similar way.</p>
<p>This last insight is of considerable practical significance, as it may help us tailor interventions that target specific employee clusters, thereby delivering maximum impact (i.e., retaining employees and reducing turnover costs) and return on our investment (i.e.&nbsp;for every $ spent we generated $xxx in savings from reduced turnover).</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have begun to open the black box that is AI, providing a simple overview of ML. We looked at three broad types of ML—reinforcement, supervised and unsupervised—and examined some simple applications of each, where possible related to Human Resources. It is our genuine belief that through greater knowledge of what is possible with ML, HRBP’s and organizational decision-makers will both expect more, and be willing to do more, in this technological domain. Our next piece will explain the step-by-step process for performing Supervised ML—making discussions with People Analytics teams more tangible and less abstract!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>
<p>We obtained data from the 2019 Unleash Conference in London, specifically the 35 start-ups and 64 sponsors that were present at the conference. Conference attendees were provided a list of company names and their “tags”, which were descriptors of the technology or HR domain that characterize the respective companies.</p>

<section id="network-analyses-how-we-did-what-we-did" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="network-analyses-how-we-did-what-we-did">Network Analyses — How we did what we did?</h2>
<p>We examined the tags using network analysis, in a technology called <a href="https://www.kenelyze.com/">Kenelyze</a> (kudos to our partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrevermeij/">André Vermeij</a>).</p>
<p>The current network examines the “influence” of HR tech among those vendors present at the 2019 Unleash Conference in London. Network Nodes were the company Tags, and company name was included as a node attribute. The network was undirected and displayed using the Force Atlas 2 layout. Nodes (i.e.&nbsp;Tags) were sized according to the number of times the Tag was used to describe an organization, and coloured according to the PageRank score (i.e.&nbsp;influence measure). The network is presented below.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-prominent-technologies-in-the-hr-tech-landscape">What are prominent technologies in the HR Tech landscape?</h2>
<p><br></p>
<section id="talent-acquisition-is-a-main-influencer" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="talent-acquisition-is-a-main-influencer">1. Talent acquisition is a main influencer</h4>
<p>The most frequent Tag, most connected to other Tags, and most influential was “Talent Acquisition (incl.&nbsp;Referrals)”. It is perhaps unsurprising that Talent Acquisition is both a common and influential domain in HR Technology. This may in part reflect the discrete nature of the recruiting process, characterized by a definitive start and end point, and a clear, binary success measure—hired or not hired. In addition, Talent Acquisition also lends itself to performance measurement, evidenced by metrics such as source of hire, time to hire, applicants per hire, cost per hire, offer acceptance per hire, etc. All discrete metrics that the technology domain has progressively digitized. Good news for Talent Acquisition functions, what about the rest of us?</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="people-analytics-and-employee-experience-are-up-and-coming" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="people-analytics-and-employee-experience-are-up-and-coming">2. People Analytics and Employee Experience are “up and coming”</h4>
<p>Following Talent Acquisition the next most frequent and influential Tags included Employee Engagement, Learning &amp; Development, People Analytics, Talent Management, and Employee Experience (EX). These Tags reflect what we interpret as a mix of established HR domains (e.g.&nbsp;Employee Engagement, Learning &amp; Development, Talent Management, HR Transformation), and “up and coming” (e.g.&nbsp;People Analytics and EX). The latter two topics have experienced a meteoric rise in prominence in recent years. However, both People Analytics and EX we anecdotally know to be technology related, and both benefit from a historical connection to data collection network nodes such as “Employee Engagement” and “Surveys (incl.&nbsp;Employee Listening)”.</p>
<p>We note two points about People Analytics and EX—first, their collective network metrics and second, the various companies that identify themselves with these two capabilities (i.e.&nbsp;click on nodes to see company listings). To us the network metrics and network position suggest that People Analytics is currently more influential (e.g.&nbsp;frequency, degree, PageRank), more central to the network (i.e.&nbsp;position), and consequently likely to play a more significant role in connecting technologies in the HR Tech landscape in the immediate future. Longer term, only time and repeated assessment of the market will tell.</p>
<p>Secondly, the companies identifying themselves with these two capabilities are varied! Our interpretation of this variation is that the terms People Analytics and EX (also applicable to “Workforce Planning”) mean many things to different people, perhaps driven by maturity of practice in the consumer population. Alternatively, it may also represent future use cases that aren’t currently mainstream, or the potential for partnership or acquisition among technology vendors. Finally, it may represent opportunistic thinking by marketing professionals!</p>

<section id="skills-are-the-new-currency" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="skills-are-the-new-currency">3. Skills are the new currency</h4>
<p>A special call out to the topic of Skills Matching, which we at Merck KGaA have invested in during 2019, and will further explore in 2020. As evidenced in the network, we believe there is real world connectivity between Skills Matching and domains such as People Analytics (our team currently owns the Skills Matching topic at Merck KGaA), Strategic Workforce Planning (i.e.&nbsp;bridging the current with the future), Talent Management, Learning &amp; Development (i.e.&nbsp;to get from the present to the future what training interventions are required), Talent Sourcing (incl.&nbsp;Referrals), and Performance Management (i.e.&nbsp;among other things a useful source of data to inform Skills Matching!). As referenced in recent predictions for 2020 by a variety of authors (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/putting-h-back-hr-10-predictions-2020-david-green/">David Green</a>, <a href="https://hello.visier.com/hr-trends-2020-ebook/">Visier</a>, <a href="https://joshbersin.com/hr-and-talent-predictions-for-2020/">Bersin</a>, etc.), we believe that “Skills are the new currency”! Kudos to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/">Ian Bailie</a> for one of our favourite stakeholder pitch lines.</p>

<section id="social-networks-appear-niche" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-networks-appear-niche">4. Social Networks appear niche</h4>
<p>Tech Tags that appeared less frequently than expected, at least considering public hype, included Digital HR and Social Networks. This may simply reflect the companies present at Unleash 2019. However, it may also be suggestive of the niche nature of this technology / approach, and the slow rate of adoption among companies due to various reasons (e.g.&nbsp;data privacy implications, prevalence of skills, lack of available use cases, etc.).</p>

<section id="next-steps" class="level1">
<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>The analysis provides a data driven exploration of the HR Tech landscape present at Unleash London in 2019. While the dataset does not claim to capture the universe of HR Tech, it does provide an interesting perspective of available technologies and how these technologies relate to one another. We encourage further exploration of the interactive network—reflect on your own hypotheses, look at the edges for new trends, examine the network structure, and consider what it might mean for the future. To make the article digestible we intentionally did not address many relationships in the network.</p>
<p>We welcome your comments, particularly additional interpretation of the network, that may generate insights and practical value for other readers. Stay tuned! We may look to squeeze further insights from this analysis (e.g.&nbsp;different algorithms, node configurations, etc.).</p>
