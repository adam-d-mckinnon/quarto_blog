It can perform both time series forecasts (i.e., predictions) and detect anomalies in only a few lines of code, thereby lowering the barriers of entry to time series analysis!\n\n<br>\n\n## Setup\n\nThe set-up here is fairly straightforward.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Forecasting\n\nHere we forecast recruitment volumes for three months. The forecast uses a combination of both historic volumes and turnover volumes. It is important to note that any exogenous variables (i.e., the turnover volume in this example) values must be present for the entire forecast window. Therefore, we will \"lag\" the turnover values by three months. This action assumes a relationship between turnover three months prior on recruitment volumes in the current month. In a business context this may reflect the required business approvals required prior to a requisition being approved and created.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Anomaly Detection\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
