## Introducing TimeGPT

TimeGPT is a generative pretrained transformer for time series forecasting, developed by Nixtla. It can perform both time series forecasts (i.e., predictions) and detect anomalies in only a few lines of code, thereby lowering the barriers of entry to time series analysis!

<br>

## Setup

The set-up here is fairly straightforward. The first thing required is to register an account with nixtla to obtain API credentials (<https://www.nixtla.io/>).

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}

library(nixtlar) # required for TimeGPT
library(tidyverse)

nixtla_set_api_key(api_key = "NIXTLA_API_KEY")

```

## Forecasting

Here we forecast recruitment volumes for three months. The forecast uses a combination of both historic volumes and turnover volumes. It is important to note that any exogenous variables (i.e., the turnover volume in this example) values must be present for the entire forecast window. Therefore, we will "lag" the turnover values by three months. This action assumes a relationship between turnover three months prior on recruitment volumes in the current month. In a business context this may reflect the required business approvals required prior to a requisition being approved and created.

## Conclusion

TimeGPT enables greater accessibility to cutting-edge forecasting and anomaly detection insights by reducing reliance on specialist skillsets in the domain. As demonstarted in this article TimeGPT is simple to use and can deliver insight fast!
